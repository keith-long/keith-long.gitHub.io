<h1>The Story of The Molecule</h1>
</font></font>
<p><font color="white" size="3">The fall os 1994 was a quixotic time for me,<font color="#00e0">
The Mad Prophet of the Apocalypse.<font color="white"> Turner Broadcasting here
in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, produced a movie about the Civil War, but instead of
being pro-Confederacy, it was about a southern prison camp called Andersonville
and it's mistreatment of Union soldiers. For the first time I had the
opportunity to be with about 60 of my closest friends getting paid to dress up
and act! It was great. Since the shots took so incredibly long to set up, and
centered mostly around the actions of the primary actors, we spent long periods
of time grouped together in the background. A true circus! It was Abe Burgess at
this point who discovered the cry which united us each and every day.
&quot;Deviants Come!&quot;, I would cry, and Abe commented that we were like a
big <font color="lightblue">Deviant Molecule<font color="white">. So there you
have it. The Deviant Molecule is both a personal fantasy and something real. It
is a community of people who are artists and aspiring artists, that have each
shared something mystical and magical with me. This page is dedicated to all
those people who have, are, and will be a part of The Molecule. It hopefully
will portray this community through it's works of art in a similar way that
musical circles like Tricky-Portishead-Primal Scream or The Legendary Pink
Dots-Skinny Puppy-Nurse With Wound-Current 93 are portrayed in their own genres.<br>
My life is devoted to musical pursuits, and as such I create lyrics that run
parallel to events in my life, yet are Mythical Stories at the same time, and
all my friends are in there somewhere! Deviant Atoms are invited to submit <a href="http://geocities.com/soho/studios/9976/lypoems.htm" target="B"><font color="green">Poems</font></a>
and other <font color="orange">Artwork <font color="white">to this site in the
hopes that a greater <font color="#ccff33">Vision<font color="white"> can be
percieved about our lives through the artwork of the group. <font color="blue">News<font color="white">
about events in the lives of the Deviants will be available, as well as a page
of <font color="yellow">Pictures<font color="white"> and <font color="red">Bios<font color="white">
(all completely true of course!) where you can meet the Deviants themselves!
Eventually, my hopes center around adapting this page to being the official page
for my musical endeavors, with a discography etc., so cross your fingers because
I believe that each and every one of us <font color="chartreuse"><blink>WILL SEE
OUR KINGDOMS COME</blink><font color="white">, if we can only stick together.
How to join The Molecule? Take my hand and hold it.....<br>
